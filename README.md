# Ridge-and-Lasso-Algorithm-Linear-Regression

The linear regression model have some problems like Overfitting and Underfitting which are prevented using Ridge and lasso Algorithms. 
The dataset is divide using train test split and a linear regression based normal prediction is made and accuracy is noted.
With the help of GridsearchCV ridge and lasso algorithms are computed using the negative mean squared error(postive can also be used).
Then we find the best parameter among the provided one and the best score and then the prediction is made and r2 adjusted score is computed to know the performance.
The dataset is unbalanced so the predictions are not very appealing.
